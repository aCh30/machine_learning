# **linear_regression_bike_predict**

Linear Regression to predict count of rental bikes based on work/non-workday and weather and seasonal information.

## **Overview**

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return has become automatic. Through these systems, user can easily rent a bike from a particular position and return at another position. The duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems.

This code predicts the total number of bikes rented on a particular day based on the information recorded for weather and seasonal conditions on that day and whether it&#39;s a work or a non-workday.

## Dependencies

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Seaborn

Python 2 and 3 both work for this. Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install any dependencies.

## Usage

Just run python3 Bike_counts.py to see the results.
